# adaptive-filter
Adaptive filter code for DSP project

The repo is currently public so everyone can pull from it, unsure if we should change it or it can stay like that (it is unlikely someone else from the course will come across it and even if, I believe we'd be able to see it). I think it will be best if I try to set up a private repo shortly.

Compiler optimization:
Compiler optimization level is determined by the project settings so it always will be overwritten with whatever the level used by last commit was. I recommend using a low optimization level for debugging - the final solution which we will submit will obviously use a high optimization level (o2 or o3, whichever turns out to be better). Note that sometimes o3 can outperform o2, so it is worth checking. Also a variety of bugs can be made manifest when using different optimization levels so be careful.
